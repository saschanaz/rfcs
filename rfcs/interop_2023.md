# RFC ??: Interop 2023

## Summary

Link to Interop 2022.

This RFC will be about the process, not the list of tests.

## Details

### Governance

Group charter? Group consensus is that new spec work is out of scope.

### Updating the tests

No test suite is perfect, and there will likely be a need to add, remove or rewrite tests during the course of the year. To suggest such non-trivial changes that would benefit from review, file an issue on the [Interop 2023 repo](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2023). The [Interop team](https://github.com/orgs/web-platform-tests/teams/interop) (TODO) will discuss at least monthly, and make decisions based on consensus. The core team will nominate the initial participants to the Interop team; thereafter the team will be able to set its own criteria for membership and participation, subject to the [WPT code of conduct](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Metrics

### Dashboard

A public dashboard tracking the metrics over time will be available at https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023.

## Background
